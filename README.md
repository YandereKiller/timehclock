# timehclock

Windows only!
In case you are not satisfied with the standart windows clock app xD

I created a simple clock application using time.h library 
(yes, I know about std::chrono, but I wanted to use time.h for this project)

It has stopwatch and timer function, also you can set pauses.
Also it's mainly based on math, so your cpu is going to have a hard time ^_^ (I'm sorry)
